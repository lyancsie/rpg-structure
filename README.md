# rpg-structure
This is intended to be a basic and flexible RPG game structure, which would be a skeleton to build upon and create my own future games. I know that such frameworks exist on a much higher level, but I'm mainly creating this because I would love to practice deisgn patterns, solid principles and I would like to keep my code as clean and flexible as I can with the least possible amount of duplications or redundancies.
